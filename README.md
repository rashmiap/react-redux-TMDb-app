# reactJS-redux-TMDb-app

Made with :heart: in React

### Get Started Immediately
You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

### Project Structure
```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    └── App
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default

Your app is ready to be deployed.
